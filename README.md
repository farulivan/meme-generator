# Getting Started 

This 'Meme Generator' is one of my projects that I did when I learn React from React Course (Scrimba) by Bob Ziroll (Head of Education at Scrimba). I also implement my knowledge of TailwindCSS in this project.

With this 'Meme Generator', users can 'instantly' get a random Meme Image only by push of a button and putting whatever text they want at the top and bottom of the Meme Image. All of these actions are happen 'instantly' because of the power of React.

## What I learned in this project

- Event Listeners
- State
- Conditional Rendering
- Forms
- Side Effects
- TailwindCSS (personal addition)
